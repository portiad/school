2.  Lossless compression breaks up the file into segments. The file is then assembled exactly as it was before it was compressed.
    Lossy compression removes redundant pieces of data. When the file is assembled back it is not the same as before it was compressed.

4.  What happens when you delete a file from the trash bin: The file is removed from the directory and the system moves all the FAT clusters to the list of free clusters.

5.  How to ensure data is deleted: Write Gutmann patterns multiple times over the disk.

6.  stdint.h: Declares a set of integer types with specific widths and defines a set of macros. 
Required fields are: int8_t, int16_t, int32_t, uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t. If there is implementation with a width 64 the below items are required int64_t, uint64_t.

7.  Declaring that they will be used in the program and assigning the required space.
8.  BYTE: 8 , DWORD: 32, LONG: 32, WORD: 16

10. bfsize is the size of the file. bisize is the size of the bitmapinfoheader.

11. biheight is negative when the file goes from top down.

12. 24

13. fopen returns NULL when the fopen fails. Examples of this is if the file already existed.

14. The 3rd argurment is always 1 because the program is reading in only one pixel.

16. fseek flushes any buffered output before setting the file position or else remembers it so it will be written later in its proper place in the file. 

17. SEEK_CUR puts the fseek on the current location.
